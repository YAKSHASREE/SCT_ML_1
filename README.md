# HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION USING LINEAR REGRESSION
Synthetic data will first be created: features and target house prices. Then, all the data will be put into a DataFrame. The dataset will be split into a training set and a test set. After, linear regression will be fitted on the training set and used to predict house prices on the test set. These include the Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and R^2 Score metrics. Finally, a scatter plot is used to visualize the correlation between actual and predicted house prices, offering insight into how well or poorly the model has done its job.
